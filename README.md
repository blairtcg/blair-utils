Blair's build currently uses PNG which this site now auto compresses your final cards submissions using rust **oxipng** wasm. Soon the idea of using .webp is plausible considering its more optimized in compressing and can achieve lossless compressions as well (more detail on blairpng repo).

This project is now hosted on cloudflare pages
  
https://sethispr.github.io/blair-utils/ is now used for testing

This website is only used for public community, blair itself has its own dedicated image micro service written in Go with Gin as the web framework but it is not open sourced.

current major issues:

- introduces flickering (card appearing and disappearing when scrolling)

fixes:

- slow scrolling in android phones using chromium browsers

- more adaptive garbage collector

- now reuses and allocates basically the entire both canvas and offscreen canvas objects instead of always creating new ones

- more memory stability also helps minimzing gc pausing

- pooled all canvas bitmap allocations

- loading bar more believable instead of hanging since it counts from file size also adds a cancel button to stop process

- now caches the uploaded image in the local memory too so not only just text being saved

- performance score drops down to 92 in mobile devices

- scrolling in android mobile doesnt feel snappy

- no performance upgrades very leaky but has perfect first load times
